Welcome to the station run entirely by computers. This segment is the work of a college student. While Matt is here with us today he will only be making sure that we don't experience any dead air on the radio. Everything else including music selection, storytelling, weather, and other small talk is entirely computer generated. That being said, let's get back to the show.
