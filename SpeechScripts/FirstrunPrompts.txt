Welcome to the station run entirely by computers. This station is the work of a college student. While Matt is occasionally here with us today, he will only be making sure that we don't experience any dead air on the radio. Everything else, including music selection, storytelling, weather, and other small talk is entirely computer selected. That being said, let's get back to the show.

However, everything on the radio, such as music selection, storytelling, weather, and other small talk is entirely computer selected. Alright, let's get back to the show.
