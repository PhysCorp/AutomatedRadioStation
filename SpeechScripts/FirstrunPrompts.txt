The demo version of this station is built in Python and hosted on Ubuntu Server.
Imagine a world where even a radio station can be automated. Well, it's a reality.
Welcome to PhysCorp's fully-automated radio station, featuring computer-selected music, public service announcements, weather info, and synthesized voices.
We're showcasing the rise of technology with this station.
Welcome to the pet project from Matt, a college student at Oakland University. I'm your computer generated host, here to make sure that you listen to the best hits, all with a traditional radio style!
Just a reminder, welcome to the station run entirely by computers. Matt, my creator, occasionally listens to make sure that we don't experience any problems. Otherwise, everything on the radio is entirely computer selected.
Remember, we have genre rotation approximately every four hours.
Remember, you can always suggest songs to be played here! Visit radio.physcorp.com to view station info and suggest a YouTube link to your favorite song!
