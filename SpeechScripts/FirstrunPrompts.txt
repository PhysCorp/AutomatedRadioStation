Welcome to the fully automated radio station. If you're curious, this station is built in Python and hosted on Ubuntu Server. The program reaches out to several APIs, such as Openweathermap, YouTube data, and Google's Wavenet. Enough tech talk, let's get back to the show.
Imagine a world where even a radio station can be automated. Well, it's a reality. Welcome to PhysCorp's fully-automated radio station, featuring computer-selected music, public service announcements, weather info, and synthesized voices. This is quite the interesting achievement if I do say so myself. I might be biased though, not only am I a computer, but I'm also talking about myself here. Anyway, let's get back to the show.
We're showcasing the rise of technology with this station. Welcome to the fully automated radio station, featuring computer-selected music, public service announcements, weather info, and synthesized voices.
Welcome to the pet project from Matt, a college student at Oakland University. I'm your computer generated host, here to make sure that you listen to the best hits, all with a traditional radio style!
Just a reminder, welcome to the station run entirely by computers. Matt, my creator, occasionally listens to make sure that we don't experience any problems. Otherwise, everything on the radio is entirely computer selected.
