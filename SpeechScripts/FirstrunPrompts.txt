Welcome to the station run entirely by computers. This station is the work of a college student. While Matt is occasionally here with us today, he will only be making sure that we don't experience any dead air on the radio. Everything else, including music selection, storytelling, weather, and the voice itself is entirely computer generated. That being said, let's get back to the show.
Welcome to the fully automated radio station. This station was built by Matt, a college student. He occasionally listens in to make sure that we don't experience any dead air on the radio. However, everything on the radio, such as music selection, storytelling, weather, and the voice itself is entirely computer generated. Alright, let's get back to the show.
Welcome to the fully automated radio station. For those wondering, this station is built in Python and hosted on Ubuntu Server. Everything on the station, including music selection, storytelling, weather info, and the voice itself is entirely computer generated. The program reaches out to several APIs, such as Openweathermap, YouTube data, and Google's Wavenet. Anyway, let's get back to the show.
Imagine a world where even a radio station can be automated. Well, it's a reality. Welcome to PhysCorp's fully-automated radio station, featuring computer-selected music, public service announcements, weather info, and synthesized voices. This is quite the interesting achievement if I do say so myself. I might be biased though, I'm a computer and I'm talking about myself here. Anyway, let's get back to the show.
